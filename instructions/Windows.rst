Installing Mantid on Windows
============================

The steps below will guide you through installation of Mantid on Windows:

1. Download the latest version of Mantid from `our website <index.html>`_.
2. Find the version of Mantid you previously downloaded. By default, it will automatically download to your `downloads` folder, which is located at: :code:`C:\Users\$USER\Downloads` where :code:`$USER` is your Windows username.
3. Double click the installer and click **Run**.
4. Go through the steps of the installer. Selecting **Next** at each stage. The default settings are recommended.
5. Once you click **Install** the installation process will begin, and inform you when it is complete.
6. That's it! Once the installation process is complete a `MantidPlot` icon will appear on your desktop, and in your start menu.

**Note:** the installer will look for the drive with the most free disk space, which may include external devices. Installing and uninstalling on these devices is extremely slow, and not recommended.
